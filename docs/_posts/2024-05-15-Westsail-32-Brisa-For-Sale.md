You're looking at a Westsail; so, you know what you're looking at.  Odds are
you're familiar with the reputation, popularity and success of the design.

This Westsail is one of the kit productions. The hull was laid in 1979 and
finished-out by master woodworker Dugan Essick using Hawaiian koa wood paneling
throughout.  Dugan was working at the time for Westsail, finishing the
interiors of the production boats. He now runs a woodworking school in Grass
Valley, California.

Dugan launched this Westsail in 1982. She sailed near her birth place for many
years, then made the bash down to Baja California where she sailed until the
current owner bought her. That's me.

We sailed in the Gulf of California for a year before crossing to mainland
Pacific Mexico, down the Pacific coast of Central America to Panama and through
the Panama Canal. We sailed in Panama for a year.

This year we sailed from Panama across the Caribbean Sea to Grand Cayman, to
Isla Mujeres, up through the Yucatan Straights to the Florida Straights and to
Key West, where I have listed her home port, where she had never before
visited. We skipped most of the keys, Miami and Fort Lauderdale offshore riding
the Gulf Stream.  I think she's itching to see the Bahamas. A little turn to
starboard would have landed us there. Or Bermuda. Or the Azores and the Canary
Islands.  Who knows?  You know.

Brisa is now sailing the northeastern United States Atlantic coastal waters.
You're getting a boat maintained in sailing form, not sitting on the hard or in
a slip.  Visit [this Garmin Explore tracking link][track], for her current

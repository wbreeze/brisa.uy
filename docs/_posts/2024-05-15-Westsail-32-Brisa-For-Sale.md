You're looking at a Westsail; so, you know what you're looking at.  Odds are
you're familiar with the reputation, popularity and success of the design.

This Westsail is one of the kit productions. The hull was laid in 1979 and
finished-out by master woodworker Dugan Essick using Hawaiian koa wood paneling
throughout.  Dugan was working at the time for Westsail, finishing the
interiors of the production boats. He now runs a woodworking school in Grass
Valley, California.

![Salon of Brisa looking forward](

)

Dugan launched this Westsail in 1982. She sailed near her birth place for many
years, then made the bash down to Baja California where she sailed until the
current owner bought her. That's me.

We sailed in the Gulf of California for a year before crossing to mainland
Pacific Mexico, down the Pacific coast of Central America to Panama and through
the Panama Canal. We sailed in Panama for a year.

)

This year we sailed from Panama across the Caribbean Sea to Grand Cayman, to
Isla Mujeres, up through the Yucatan Straights to the Florida Straights and to
Key West, where I have listed her home port, where she had never before
visited. We skipped most of the keys, Miami and Fort Lauderdale offshore riding
the Gulf Stream.  I think she's itching to see the Bahamas. A little turn to
starboard would have landed us there. Or Bermuda. Or the Azores and the Canary
Islands.  Who knows?  You know.

Brisa is now sailing the northeastern United States Atlantic coastal waters.
You're getting a boat maintained in sailing form, not sitting on the hard or in
a slip.  Visit [this Garmin Explore tracking link][track], for her current
location exactly.

## Head

In the head you find a tiled counter with small sink, foot pump for seawater,
mirrored cabinet and an [AirHead][airhead]® composting toilet. There is plenty
of storage in the head, as there is everywhere. It has a small porthole that
opens and a freznel skylight.

)

## Wardrobe and Pullman Berth

In the bow, find a pullman berth. The pullman berth is an alternative
arrangement to the more common V-berth. It offers an ample sleeping space for
two people. Unlike the V-berth, it offers ample storage alongside the sleeping
space.  The dimensions of the sleeping area are eighty inches by forty-four
inches (80" x 44").

Also in these photos see the wardrobe facing the head. The wardrobe offers
a vertical hanging closet, five wardrobe drawers, a shelf and a large
compartment behind, accessed through the wardrobe.

For storage, every space between what you can see in the cabin and the hull is 
accessible. The forms for entry to Cayman Islands contained the questions:

 - are there any hidden compartments?
 - where are they?

The answers were, yes and everywhere.

## FAQ

- When was the last time she was hauled out for bottom work?

  In April, 2024, after about eighteen months. She has had bottom paint three
  times now in 3-1/2 years. The haul-out in 2021, in the arid Baja desert,
  dried and attended to blisters, then applied three coats of West epoxy
  barrier treatment before painting.  The first three coats are blue and
  additional coats are red. Seeing blue, it is time to repaint. The bottom
  paint is ablative copper. Quantity required is about a gallon for one coat.
  Painting has been three gallons except the most recent was two.  We paint
  extra coats around prop and rudder, at the bow and along the waterline. Those
  are the areas that go fastest. Prop and rudder zincs are replaced fresh every
  time.  All maintenance by the current owner, since 2020 is logged.

- How old is standing and running rigging?

  The standing rigging is less than ten years old done by the prior owner.  It
  is good for coastal sailing, Bahamas, all motoring distance to shore. It
  might be safest to overhaul it if crossing the Atlantic. The main sail is new
  in 2023. The four head sails are holding up well. She also has a trysail used
  rarely, like new.

  The running rigging is all replaced at various times in the past three years.

- What motor is in the boat?

  The motor is a Universal Westerbeke M-50B, 43hp installed around Y2K, with
  currently 2500hrs. Regular oil changes, zinc replacements, and clean fuel
  keep her running well. All maintenance by the current owner, since 2020 is
  logged.

)

- What electronics?

  If there is some bit of electronic kit that you think is indispensable on a
  sailboat, that you have your heart set on acquiring with the boat, why not buy
  the kit, forget the boat, and save a ton of money? That is tongue in cheek
  and also realistic: the foundation is key-- a good, seaworthy boat.

  I've seen people sit for months in Panama waiting to have insurance cover,
  ship, and install their expensive electronics knocked out by a lightning
  strike. They couldn't leave to sail and enjoy-- sea, sun, surf, snorkel,
  reefs, fish, dolphins, cocktails in a secluded cove of paradise --without the
  gadgets.

  She will come with an inReach and iPad mini. She has a Vesper AIS installed
  new in 2021 with dedicated VHF and GPS antennas. The Navionics app knows how
  to connect to it for very accurate position, direction, speed over ground.
  Recently replaced Uniden UM725G VHF with new 1/2" coax running up the mast to
  a new Shakespeare antenna is in the salon with a remote station in the
  cockpit. Depth sounder. In a locker, find a working, older radar setup
  removed when installing the AIS. She carries an iCom IC-M710 SSB complete
  with tuner and antenna that functions to get weather faxes.

- What wind vane is on it?

  She has a Monitor wind vane that has worked fabulously and is aging. It is
  amazing when it is in operation. It is worth $1k as trade-in toward a new
  one. Also installed are two tiller pilots: a Pelagic and a TP20. She sails a
  close reach hands off, tiller free. Other points of sail need something or
  someone attending to light forces on the tiller. Forces are always light with
  good sail trim.

- What sails does she have?

The sail inventory includes a new mainsail, a staysail, and three foresails.
The foresails are: a 60% jib, 100% yankee, and 130% genoa. (Those are
estimated percent of the area of the triangle formed by mast, forestay, and
deck.) See them in the photos. There is also a storm trysail that runs on a
separate track from the main. Find an article about [using the trysail off the
coast of Nicaragua, in the Papagayo.][reposo] The article is written in
Spanish and has pictures.

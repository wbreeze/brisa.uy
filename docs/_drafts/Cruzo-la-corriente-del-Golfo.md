[Once de diciembre]({{ '/2025/12/11/ICW-NC.html' | relative_url }}) escribí
como si va a orrepentir no sufrir un periodo de malas condiciones para salir en
ruta a Puerto Rico.  Dije, «En dos semanas veremos dónde estoy, si sigo
soñando, si me arrepiento de no haber llegado en Puerto Rico.» De verdád, no me
lo arrepiento.

Pudiera visitar a la ciudad de Charlestown en Carolina de Norte una segunda
ves. Fuí a la zona francesa para ver los luces. Tenía olor de horseshit from
the horse drawn carriages that give tours. The mood of the people did not
feel very festive. It felt more like a city under siege to me, the feeling
of films from the time of the german occupation of france, or of the
dictatorships in el cono del sur durante las setentas. Perhaps it was me.

La novía, una conocida who looked me up cuando estaba en Nueva York, en octubre,
me quitó el día ante que llegé a Saint Augustine en Florida. Voy a
estrañar compartiendo noticias y fotos diarias con ella.

En Saint Augustine the mood was much more festive. People were laughing
and chattering with each other. It makes me wonder what was in the news
when I visited Charlestown. Maybe it is good that I don't follow the
daily news cycle of the United States.

Decidi cruzar el corriente del Golfo (el Golfo de America, no de Mexico,
según todos los documentos y publicaciones recién revisadas como la propoganda
en el libro, _Fahrenheit 451_ o el libro _1984_) desde Fort Pierce. Había
un periodo de viento bajo. Anticipé un mar tranquilo para cruzar.

Desde Fort Pierce,
The idea is to begin with some miles south, then direct myself perpendicular to
the stream to get across as rapidly as possible. The stream carries me
north. Once across, recuperate the miles south.

A las uno de la mañana, noté:

«There's hardly any wind. Maybe be a breath of wind from the south. The sea
the surface of the sea
service as the sea is fairly smooth. The swell is from the northeast.  It is
against the current. Half to one and a half meters. every once in a while, a set
of one and a half meter waves comes along with faces that are quite steep. They
roll about really good.  Stuff clatters around, you know. Sometimes things
shake loose and fly about. It's difficult to move about the cabin.
The good news is that I'm ahead of my forecast position, so I'm
making good time. This will be all over and a couple few hours.»

One can't always have ideal conditions. I realize that it isn't necessary to
beat myself up when I don't have them. Conditions will sometimes be marginal,
for example:

- motoring directly into fifteen knots of wind with the change
in the current delayed because of the wind blowing the water in, seeing only
2.7 knots; or 
- getting rocked violenty by short but steep waves broadside on the boat
while motoring across the gulf stream.

The upside when those things happen will always be that things will improve.

There are some ships out here with me. A pair of cruise ships I saw. A cargo
ship.  A few others distant. No other pleasasure boats. I think this is a clue.
 If you're not leaving to cross with an armada of other pleasure boats, it
might be a bad time to do it. Also, clearly, the majority start from further
down the coast of Florida. Fort Pierce is the very most northern departure
point for the Bahamas. It might be better to start from Palm Beach or further
south.

Arriving at the little bahamas bank north of Grand Bahama Island, well past the
gulf stream and sheltered by the barrier reef to the northeast, the sea is
flat. With daytime I see that it is turquoise blue over a white sand bottom. It
is strange to sail with only three to six meters of water beneath the boat. The
water is clear, at last. I haven't seen my anchor touch bottom since leaving
Mexico nearly two years ago.

Here I am in the Bahamas ready for the start of another year, another chapter.
I'm anchored at Great Sail Cay, well sheltered from fresh northwest winds
brought by a passing cold front. There have been a couple of showers.  I'm
flying the quarentine flag, the solid yellow letter 'Q' from the starboard flag
halyard. This signifies that no-one should visit.

None of the other boats anchored here would come visiting, anyway. We have the
internet, now. We all got here navigating by GPS, with highly accurate,
supercomputer generated wind, wave and current forecasts. Any half-baked idiot
with money to spend can do it, myself included.  It's nothing special.  There
is no need to visit personally or be neighborly in the old-fashioned way.

I will not be leaving the boat, either, until I check-in with the border
authorities after arriving at Green Turtle Cay.

So why is it that my artificially intelligent phone can't learn that when I
unplug it and it comes on, I have reflexively, due to some earlier training,
pressed the power button? It turns off and then I have to press the power
button again to turn it on. How is it not intelligent enough to see that
pattern and learn not to turn on when I unplug it, or not to turn off when I
unplug it and press the button? No. It wants to train me instead, not to press
the power button when I unplug it. Who is in control here? Am I, or is it the
machine?

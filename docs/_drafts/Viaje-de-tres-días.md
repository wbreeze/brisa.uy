There were pelicans and dolphins this afternoon on the way out of Hampton Roads.
I always take that as a good sign. Pelicans are marvelous to see, as well as
dolphins. Dolphins were playing alongside me in the strong current
flowing against me there by Fort Monroe and Point Comfort.

The pelicans are fishing.  They are having a good time in their lives. Well, I
say they are having a good time.  They appear friendly and fond to me. That is
what I mean. My impression is that they are having a good time.  The dolphins
and the pelicans are part of the life that I enjoy out here sailing.

A pair of container ships play chicken in the channel. "We'll see each other
port to port," they agree. "One whistle." They pass with a boat length between
them.

Two days later, late in the afternoon, twenty miles offshore from the mouth of
the Delaware River, off the coast of Ocean City, Maryland, recreational fishing
boats zoom past at thirty knots, racing from their offshore adventure to cozy
berths in town.  They catch me bathing. I have stopped the boat, tied the
rudder over to starboard, thrown the ladder overboard, stripped naked and
jumped into the blue water, rinsing away sweat and heat, restoring some vigor
to my spirit and my bones.  The trip is half over.

The next day the wind comes up. It comes up fiercely, like a lion, right on
the bow. White caps form everywhere cresting waves of nearly a meter.
The waves stop the boat dead, nearly dead sometimes. I cannot make more than
two knots on average motoring against these waves and wind.

I tack offshore close to the wind, but still away, back, losing ground.
I want to do it early, before the wind clocks east as it is forecast to do.
When it clocks east, tacking offshore will send me even more badly on the
reverse track.  After several hours I calculate that I've gone far enough, I
can tack back to the northeast and parallel the coast of New Jersey to Sandy
Hook reaching close to starboard.

The tack is disappointing. Instead of tacking through one-hundred twenty
degrees as I've hoped, I've tacked through one-hundred fifty degrees.
Will it be enough? If the wind clocks soon enough, yes. I pass the next
four hours holding the boat close to the wind and hoping for the wind to
clock. Not until evening does it clock sufficiently that my course will
clear land and take me parallel with the shore. It happens just in time.
Mother nature is teasing me, stressing me, letting me know who is in charge,
dominating me, insisting that I give-in to her, surrender to her. Such a
supreme dominatrix is mother nature. I submit.

After some hard sailing, as night sets in, I'm on a beam reach with a light
breeze, just gliding along. Submission has brought reward.  Orange sodium
street lights blaze like fires along the Jersey Shore. At two in the morning
some early recreational fishing boats make bee-lines away from Manesquan inlet,
out to sea, with powerful headlamps on towers, pointed over their bows, burning
ahead of them into the darkness.

This is so exciting. I'm approaching Sandy Hook. It's five thirty in the
morning and oh, the world is starting to be dusky gray. Something like that.
It's starting to just have a little bit of light in it. I can't tell from
where. It's all overcast and gray, everywhere cloud low hanging, no fog, thank
goodness. Gods, could you imagine doing this in the fog?  Over there to
port the lights of shore and then to starboard, out to sea, nothing
but a dim horizon were sea meets sky. Sea meets cloud. Ahead of me there are
lights of-- what is it? --a fishing boat maybe, but it's receding from me, so
not a factor of concern. It recedes and recedes without diminishing. The closer
I get to it, the further away it is.

My course is between the shipping lanes and the coast, about ten miles
offshore.

The sea is smooth. There's no wind. The wind died hours ago, leaving only an
ocean swell that comes in steeply. Sometimes waves as much as a meter high
rock and roll Brisa, violently shaking everything within. Things inside
rattle and clatter and sometimes fall. They're called "sets" when the
surfers see them coming. "Hi, here comes a set" they'll think.  They'll get
excited and set up to surf.

But now, for me, it's like ooh, here comes a roly poly time. I can't see them
coming anyway as it is dark. The first wave announces the rest. I'm chattering
away to myself out loud because I'm completely sleep deprived. Sleep deprived.
I slept in snatches in the night, little twenty minute snatches, and not many
of them either. Just enough to keep me going. I had one delightful run of
snatches after I watched a barge pass me, when there was still sailing and there
was still wind. And then I woke up and it was over because a gust of wind had
come to move the boat at six knots-- over five knots steady.

I think, "Why do we speed up like this." I came out and all of a sudden I saw
that there are all of these dark clouds setting-in over the shoreline. Ahead is
black. Out to sea the moonlight shows cloud. I thought, "Oh my God, there's a
thunderstorm. You have a storm. It is going to get stormy now. I had better get
ready." I had all of this sail flying because the forecast was for the wind to
gradually slack to nothing. So I dropped all of the sails in a panic.  Then
started the rolling. Then started the getting rocked while motoring along.

From there was a nightmare. Maybe I was overcautious, dropping all the sail.
Maybe I could have a little sail.  "Enough of that," I thought.  Let me try
motoring with some sail up. See what happens. I'll just sheet them in tight.  I
put up a little sail and tried to sail on that for a while, motor saling. That
worked out fine until the wind died completely. And then I was just rocking and
rolling with sails flogging. Not even the motor could fill them.

Now I'm motoring along, getting rocked and rolled, trying to catch snatches of
sleep and failing. And now, now there's no way, no way that I can sleep. Not a
chance.  My course closes with the land. Too close to land.  There's much too
much going on around me.  Well, potentially with the rocking and the rolling, I
don't know what I'm one hour from the entry. Well, an hour and thirty minutes,
it says from the entrance to the channel that goes around the top of the Sandy
Hook.

Right now there's a current of one knot running out past the top of Sandy
Hook. I wouldn't want to be there if I could. I'm only seeing 3 1/2 knots
anyway.  Well, maybe four.  The tide is... I don't know. I don't know what it
is doing because I can't see the moon. I see the sun is rising.  The moon is
high up. I don't know what's going on.  It is four in the morning confusion.

Anyway, look. The chart says that the current is running out past the top of
Sandy Hook. If I was there now, I would be swimming upstream. No. I'm not there
yet.  I won't be there for another two hours. By then it will have abated.  It
will have slacked enough not to harm me, anyway.

No, no. I'll round the hook and put down the anchor and try to get some sleep.
According to the chart it'll be about nine o'clock by then. There. Four hours.
I have to survive four hours.  I have to go sleep deprived through the little
channel. Try to make out the lights and the buoys.

Fortunately, it will be light time arriving with the light dawning as I, even
as I've talked, I feel like it has gotten lighter. Beautiful.  Beautiful,
diffuse, light sunshine and I'll be able to navigate. I'll be able to see the
Sandy Hook. I'll be able to put down the anchor and go rest.  Go rest finally
from this slog.

It is so cloudy. I can't even tell where the light is coming from. It's just
getting lighter grayly.  Gray, gray, lighter gray just to show, to where some
talk of some dimmer, not darker, dimmer, dimmer, dimmer gray. I know that the
sun must be out there in the east or with the ocean somewhere, but I can't see
it. I know that it is coming because the world is getting lighter,
imperceptibly. It was pitch black yet now I can see the surface of the sea.
 It's a big change, I can tell you.

Time is passing strangely, oddly slowly and quickly skipping light, it feels
like it's getting light fast. It feels like it's taking forever.  I know.
Yesterday the sun came up a big orange ball. I was out in the Atlantic where,
down by Cape May...  What a day that was. Now I don't know if I'll see the sun
rise. All I see is that the world is getting lighter.

I don't even know what day it is. I do know. It's Saturday.  I left
on Wednesday night, Thursday night, Friday night. Wednesday, Thursday, three
nights out here, sleeping in snatches. The little snatches of twenty minutes and
beside myself. I just want to rest. Coastal passages. Whoa. Coastal passages are
awful. Awful!  Take me out to sea, out to sea, out to sea where I can just
forget the world and sleep at night. Here we go. That's all I have to say. Soon
we will have arrived.

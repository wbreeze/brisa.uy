There were pelicans and dolphins this afternoon on the way out of Hampton Roads.
I always take that as a good sign. Pelicans are marvelous to see, as well as
dolphins. Dolphins were playing alongside me in the very strong current
coming into Hampton Roads, there by the fort. The pelicans are fishing.
They are having a good time in their lives. Well, I say they are having a good time.
They appear, friendly and fond to me. That is what I mean. My
impression is that they are having a good time.  The dolphins and the pelicans are part
of the life that I enjoy out here sailing.

A pair of container ships plays chicken in the channel. "We'll see each other
Port to port," they agree. "One whistle." They pass with a boat length between
them.

Late in the afternoon off the coast of Ocean City, Maryland, twenty miles
offshore from the mouth of the Delaware River, recreational fishing boats zoom
past at thirty knots,
racing from their offshore adventure to cozy berths in town.
They catch me bathing. I have stopped the boat, tied the rudder over to
starboard, thrown the ladder overboard, stripped naked and jumped
into the blue water, rinsing away sweat and heat, restoring some vigor to
my spirit and my bones.
The trip is half over.

This is so exciting. I'm approaching sandy hook. It's five thirty in the
morning. and oh, the world is starting to be dusky gray, something like that.
 It's starting to just have a little bit of light in it. I can't tell from
where. It's all overcast and gray, everywhere cloud low hanging, no flog, thank
goodness God, could you imagine doing this in the fog?  Ooh, over there to p
port the lights of sandy hook of New Jersey shore and then out to sea nothing,
a dim horizon were sea meet sky, sea meet cloud, and then ahead of me, the
lights of what is it a fishing boat maybe, but it's receding from me, so not a
factor.Receding receding the closer I get to it the further away it is

The sea is smooth, there's no wind. The wind died hours ago, leaving
only an ocean swell that comes in steeply, sometimes waves as much as a meter
high rocking and rolling Brisa, violently shaking everything within rattling and
clattering, and sometimes falling. They're called "sets" when the 
surfers see them coming. Hi, here comes a set they'll think.  They'll get excited and set
up to surf.

But now for me, it's like ooh, here comes a roly poly time, but I
can't see them coming anyway as dark. And I'm chattering away because I'm
totally sleep deprived. sleep deprived.  I slept in snatches last night, little
20 minute snatches. here and there, and not many of them either. just enough to
keep me going. I had one delightful run of snatches after I watched a barge
pass me, and there was still sailing and there was still wind. And then I woke
up and it was over because a gust of wind had come the boat was doing six knots--
over five knots.

I think, "Why do we speed up like this.", and I came out and all of
a sudden I saw that there were all these dark clouds around it was like, oh my
God, there's a thunderstorm. You a storm is going to get stormy now. I better
get ready.  And I dropped all the sails and then started rolling, getting
rocked motoring along.

From there was a nightmare. Maybe I was
overcautious, dropping all the sail.  Maybe I could have a little sail, so I
put up a little sail and tried to sail on that for a while, and that worked out
fine until well, the wind died completely. And then I was just rocking and
rolling with sails flogging.

"Enough of that," I thought.  Let me try motoring with
these sails up. See what happens. I'll just sheet them in tight and I did that
for a while.  That that helped. That worked until there was absolutely no wind
at all. or whatever. I don't know, no wind at all and even while motoring the
sails were just flogging and then I had to take those down.

 And then I'm
motoring along, getting rocked and rolled. trying to catch snatches of sleep
and failing. And now, now there's no way, no way what I sleep not a chance I
must too close to land. There's much too much going on around me.  Well,
potentially when the rocking and the rolling, I don't know what I'm one hour
from the entry. Well, an hour and 30 minutes, it says from the entrance to the
channel that goes around the top of the sandy hook.

And right now there's a
current of one know running out past the top of that sandy hook, and I wouldn't want
to be there if I could. I'm only seeing 3 1/2 knots anyway.  Well, maybe four.
The tide is I don't know, what it is doing because I can't see the moon. I see
the sun is rising.  The moon is high up. I don't know what's going on..

But
anyway.  Look, chart says that the current is running out past the top of Sandy
Hook. And if I get it was there now, I would be swimming upstream. No, I'm not
there yet.  I'll be there for another two hours. By then it will have abated.
It will have
slacked enough not to harm me anyway.

 No, no I'll round the hook and put down
the anchor and try to get some sleep.
According to the chart it'll be about
nine o'clock by then. There. Four hours. I have to survive four hours.  I have
to go sleep deprived through the little channel. Try to make out the lights and
the buoys.

Fortunately, it will be light time arriving with the light dawning
as I even as I've talked, I feel like it's gotten lighter.' beautiful.
beautiful, diffuse, light sunshine and I'll be able to navigate I'm able to see
the sandy hook I'm able to put down the anchor and go rest.  Go rest finally
from this log.

It was so cloudy I can't even tell where the light is coming from. It's just
getting lighter grayly.
Gray gray lighter gray just show to where some talk of some dimmer, not darker,
dimmer. dimmer dimmer gray. I know that the sun must be out there in the east
or with the ocean somewhere, but I can't see it. I know is that it's coming
because it's getting lighter, like imperceptibly, like it was pitch black, and
now I can see the surface of the sea.  It's a big change, I can tell you. Time
has passing strangely, oddly slowly and quickly skipping light, it feels like
it's getting like fast. It feels like it's taking forever.  I know. Yesterday
the sun came up a big orange ball. I was out in the Atlantic where. down by
Cade May.  What a day that was now. I don't know if I'll see the sun rise. All
I see is that the world is getting lighter.


I don't even know what day it is. I know. It's Saturday.  I left
on Wednesday night, Thursday night, Friday night, Wednesday, Thursday, three
nights out here, sleeping in snatches. The little snatches of 20 minutes and
beside myself. I just want to rest. Coastal passages. whoa, coastal passages are
awful. awful.  Take me out to sea, out to sea, out to sea where I can just
forget the world and sleep at night. Here we go. That's all I have to say. soon
we will have arrived.

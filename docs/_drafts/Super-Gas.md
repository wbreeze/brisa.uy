I redid the propane locker. I took out the old tanks. I
cleaned it.  I took out the old regulator and solenoid valve. I repaired the
mounts. I installed a new regulator and a solenoid valve with
many fewer connections than was there before-- probably half is many.
It is more solid and direct. I imagine it is quite nicely sealed.
 I'm sure of it actually. It is not leaking.

I have in that locker a propane
detector that would -- it was connected to a bit of electronics that, if it
detected propane, it would interrupt the propane supply by shutting
the solenoid. (That is if the solenoid was not already shut.)

I disconnected it.  I have a detector on the front of my face that works every
time that I open that locker.

If a detector finds propane in the propane locker, it is not
so threatening. That goes overboard, outside of the boat.
To prevent me from being able to continue to function-- to
cook my coffee --because of that detector... it is drastic and robotic; so, I
disconnected it.

What I do have is a detector that is independent. It is mounted under the
stove, wired to twelve votes, always powered. If it detects
propane fumes, or the fumes of isopropol alcohol that I'm using to clean something,
or the fumes of acetone, or butane when I refill the lighter... If it detects
any of those it will chirp madly and insist on attention.

In this case I mute it or disconnect it, because I know that it is the
acetone fumes, and reconnect it later.  So there, I do have something that
reliably detects the presence of propane fumes and will advise me to do
something urgently.

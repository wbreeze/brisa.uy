Es un milagro de verdad. Dos caballos en un paquete de treinta centimetros
cuadrados. Me parece que una mula sería más dispuesto a complacer.

I emptied out the gasoline from the tank of the little 2-1/2 horsepower
outboard motor that powers my dinghy, that I can put around in, get from
ship to shore and back again. I put fresh
gas in it. I tried to start it.  After about two hundred pulls
on the starting cord it came to life. It ran and remained running.
I let it warm up for a while. Then I went out to explore. At first, I stayed
near the boat in case it quit, and I had to row back.  So I did that. For about
twenty minutes, went up a creek, explored it, came back out onto the main waterway.
Went up and down a little bit within sight of the boat.

I decided that
the engine was working just fine. I went up Blackwater Creek. I thought I'd
go to the Blackwater Creek Trading Post and have a look that looked like,
according to Google Maps, they had ice cream there. Cold drinks. It was hot.
That would be fine. So I
started up in this maze of waterways among the two meter high rushes
growing, with dragonflies and blackbirds, sometimes a stump, the occasional tree. I
worried about whether I'd find my way back because little water
passage ways led off the main creek.

 I began to feel frightened that I wouldn't be able
to find my bed, that I'd make a wrong turn and be lost in this maze of rushes
for hours until nighttime. But of course, I had my phone with me with my
nautical map on it. It was really no worry.  Provided the phone worked, had a
location, got some kind of a cell signal. Even then, I have my maps downloaded.
Even with no cell signal, I could find my way back.

So I'm going along, and
then the motor starts running rough. Then it quits.  Now I'm about
three kilometers from
the boat.  And I think, "Ooh. I guess I'll have to row back."
Of course it's upwind rowing back. The wind isn't too strong, though.
I row.

Every once
in a while I stop to take a rest. I rest myself by pulling on the starter cord
of the engine to try to make it run. It would start with the throttle wide
open.  As soon as I started to close the throttlele, it would quit. Or as soon
as I put it into gear to engage the prop, it would quit. Sounds like I don't
know what's wrong with this engine.  I don't know why it doesn't work. What's
wrong with my engine? Why doesn't it work?  I meditate on that while
rowing.

Eventually, I found my way back to the boat. It was all good.  
Back with the boat I put the engine away. Oh, well. I'll have to work this
out. I'll get it straight later.

Are you still with me? I went back.  You know, to the dead engine.
In Norfolk, in the anchorage. It isn't really too far to
row to shore. No problem, the row to shore. What I really like is to have the
engine working. With the engine working, I could motor across the
river, across the big wide channel.  I don't think I want to row across the big
wide channel. I can row into the marina. To row across the big white channel
with the barges going by and big boats and so forth, going fast, might not be
a smart thing to do. It would be like crossing the road along the rambla
hopping on one foot at rush hour.

I tried for most of the day to get the engine
running. I tried various things.  One of the things I tried was-- the engine
works really well when it has that ethanol free gasoline. That is gas that doesn't have
any ethanol in it. I thought, "Well, where do I get ethanol free gas?"
It turns out that you can make it. You just mix some water in your
fuel. The water absorbs the ethanol. Then, of course,
you have to have it let it settle. If you think fuel with ethanol isn't
going to burn in my engine, you can be sure that fuel with water isn't going to
burn in my engine.

I put the water in the tank. I let it sit and separate overnight, actually, before
draining the water out from the bottom, as supposedly with the ethanol in it,
until I smelled gas.  I tried again.
I didn't have any success. Oh.

I emptied the tank again.
There was still a lot of water in the tank.
I had emptied it into a cup, into a paint cup.
I saw it separating. So I let sit there and separate and then siphoned-off the
gasoline that was on the top, into the tank. Then I tried starting it
again.  This time it tried to start, but it didn't actually run. It was better.

Then, oh, let me check the spark plug.  I took the spark plug
out. The spark plug is fine. It is a brand new spark plug as the engine is
brand new and it is fine. It is good.  I
cleaned off the points anyway. They weren't even truly dirty.
I rubbed the contacts with some 300 grit sand paper. I sprayed it with some electronics
cleaner. Nice and shiny.

With the spark plug reinstalled of course there is no difference. The engine
performance is the same. Vacant. Missing. Uncooperative. Useless. Well.
Not useless. I'm getting excellent arm exercise.

The next day I'm out, I thought, ah, let me try going to a hardware store.
 Sometimes they sell ethanol free gasoline. I rowed to the shore and I had
lunch and I started using public transportation to get me places, riding the
buses. Waiting for a bus I think, well let me call the hardware store. That way
it is easier. I don't have to go all the way out there. I call them. Of course,
the little boy who answers doesn't know what I'm talking about.

"Do you sell gasoline in cans?"

"Yes, we sell gas cans."

"No, do you gasoline that
doesn't have ethanol?  Ehanol free gasoline? Do you sell that?"

"No, we
don't sell gasoline."

"Sometimes, you know, a hardware store will have
canned, pure gasoline-- gallon cans with gasoline for for a small engines,
for, you know, your yard lawn equipment."

"No, we don't we don't sell that."

Okay! Saves me a trip. Maybe. Or maybe he didn't know what he
was talking about because he didn't know what I was talking about.
 And if, in
fact, it was the story, that he didn't know about it...  I decided to take his
word for it, the young kid, probably at the cash register. Worked there a
month and hadn't explored the store. I don't know.  Hopefully,
he understood me and knew what he was talking about.

So I didn't go to the hardware store. but I
had gotten on the bus and found myself out into the suburban wasteland. You
don't have to go very far out of Norfolk to be in the suburban wasteland.  You
know how it is-- nothing but roads and cars. Gas stations.
I'm using the maps on my phone to guide me. I thought oh, well, let me search
online. I search online, "where to find ethanol free gas."  It suggested adding,
"near me."
Okay, "near me." Up pops a couple
of gas stations and they're like around the corner, you know,
half a kilometer walking. So I walk over in the heat in the
brutal sun beaten heat of the day. I look at the pumps that all say,
"Contains up to ten percent ethanol." I go inside.  They don't know what I'm
talking about either. "No ethanol free gas, no. We sell... I don't know what
that is.  We sell what's on the pumps." "We don't sell anything else, no." Okay.

So, even though my artificially intelligent online source thought that they
would sell it, they don't. There was another one right around the corner.
Let me try that
one.  No, not that either.

I don't know what to do. My engine doesn't run.
Do I take it apart? Do I take apart the carburator and put it back together
again? Do I try the water trick again to make ethanol free gas?

Here's what happened. The two cycle engines,
two stroke engines, work just fine.  They are very reliable. They work
really well. They are not legal anymore because they are too dirty.
They are too noisy. They have too many emissions. All
those little marine engines and lown mower engines were destroying the environment.
The Environmental Protection Agency made
them illegal. You can't buy a two cycle engine in the United States.

I bought one of these new, four cycle engines, four strokes.
The thing about the carbureted four stroke engines is that they do
really poorly on gas that has ethanol in it. They just don't burn ethanol well.
The fuel injected engines manage it, no problem. A carbureted engine, no.
Try getting a fuel injected, four stroke, two and a half horsepower engine for a
little dingy. You just can't get it.  It's too small an engine to
have fuel injection. So it is carburated.

Now gasoline without
ethanol, you know, it is not efficient.  It doesn't have any
renewable resources in it, so, I don't know, for whatever reason, the
government decided that all gasoline will have 10% ethanol in it.
Cars can run on it, after all. It makes the gasoline at least 10% renewable.
Grow more corn. Who knows what the motivations were? who lobbied
for it, or whatever it is.

You can't buy a two cycle engine and you
can't buy ethanol free gas. So my poor little two and a half horsepower,
carbureted dinghy motor is left out.  There's no way to support it.
I'm surprised that I was able to buy it. Oh, well, the place I bought
it, in Florida-- they had ethanol free gas.
 In Key West, Florida. I don't know.
I guess, there are still places in the world where you can get ethanol free
gas. If you go traveling, you're not going to find them.  Not in the United
States anyway.

That's life of the United States. That's how it works.  If
you're anywhere out of the mainstream, you're just out on a limb.
I feel very alienated by it. It is a fact. The
people making the rules haven't considered my
way of life or my needs. That doesn't matter. The majority
find that a world in which you can only get ten percent ethanol fuel and can't
get a two cycle engine to be perfectly acceptable. It is not a problem for them.

I don't know what I'm going to do with the engine.
Sometimes I have to resist
mightily the temptation to simply throw it overboard.
That is what I did with the last one, essentially. I left it on a street
in Key West with a note, "Take me. I'm yours. Beware. I'll give you trouble."

I bought three liters of gas and shook five-hunddred mililiters of water in it.
In the morning I siphoned-off the gas from the top.
If you are a desperate alcoholic or bent on suicide, you push the straw all of
the way to the bottom and drink out the ethanol. That is not a suggestion.

The ethanol free gas did not help. It did not start with the ethanol free gas.
It is something else.  I took apart the carburetor and found a problem.
The inside was all gummed-up with gooey, brown fuel, like shellac.
This is what happens to the gasoline when it sits
too long. It turns into shellac. Any fuel does this. The fuel stabilizer
that I put in is supposed to help prevent it. I left the engine for a long,
long time, more than half a year. From November until July.
Without running it. That gas was just sitting in there, turning
into shellac inside the carburetor.

The carburetor cleaner spray. I had to be careful not to get it on my skin.
It burned on contact. It was just painful to get it on me.
It's from Mexico. It is probably illegal in the United States.
It did the job.

The carburetor was quite brown and gummy.
It is very clear that the gasoline that sat in the carburetor for so long
had turned to shellac and gummed up the carburetor. Why it ran for a little
while is a mystery beyond my understanding. I must have been lucky.

I cleaned it out. Now you know. It is not only the ethanol in the gas.  The
ethanol will corrode the gaskets and the metal parts, but that is not the
problem, yet.  The problem is leaving the fuel in there too long.  Gasoline,
even with stabilizer in it. It will turn into shellac and gum up. This is how
I'm destroying the engines-- by not using them.

Apparently what you can do is... I found a
little dream valve that will drain out the carburetor. I could try
pickling my carburetor when I'm not going to use the engine for a while.  So
long as I know that I'm not using it for a while. It's another thing to pay
attention to.  I can do that. "A while" would be, I'd say two months
would be plenty long. Then I should drain it and maybe pour some
fuel stabilizer into it to take its place, not just air. We'll see.
I have never read that people pickle with fuel stabilizer. I have read in the
manual a recommendation that you drain the tank if you're not going to use it.

So. It is me.
It is not the world.  I can blame the world. I can blame ethanol. I can blame
the EPA.  What it is is the way I live and what I do. I don't do enough in
terms of taking care of that engine to keep it running. I didn't know
enough. That's the way.

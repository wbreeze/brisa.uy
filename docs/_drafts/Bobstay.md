What I did here with the bobstay is this: I started with the stainless steel
cable and then I wrapped it with with athletic tape.  That is the white
athletic tape that they use to wrap your body when you have sprained something.
It is made of cotton and is adhesive. It's stuck to the stainless steel cable.
That's called parsceling.

Then I took some nylon cord and I wrapped it tightly in a spiral all the way up
the length of the bob stay.  That is called serving.

Lastly I took some of that liquid black goop, the liquid rubber. I painted it
on top of the spiral of nylon cord and that is I don't know what it's called. A
good morning.

The purpose of the parceling and serving and coating is to protect the bobstay
from the anchor. The anchor strikes the bobstay when it comes up and down.  It
also protects from any chaffe of the anchor chain when I am at anchor.

Although at anchor I'm on a snubber that's made of nylon rope, I still have the
chain hanging down there, dangling down there next to the bobstay. As the boat
moves around on the anchor, pulling on the snubber, the chain moves around and
rubs on the bobstay and makes a hell of a noise inside. It sounds like the
world is coming to an end up in the bow.  But no, it's just the chain rubbing
on the bobstay.

Hopefully this parceling and serving and rubber coating will quiet that down.
